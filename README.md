# Mautic Lasso Bundle
A Plugin helping you to catch webhooks in Mautic

Status: need fixes
We think, that a plugin, that is able to capture any payload into Mautic represents a great value.
The Lasso plugin supposed to be able to solve this problem.
We developerd this plugin 2 years ago for Mautic 3, and would by happy to port it to Mautic 4 and 5.

The plugin doesn't work at the momment, any help is appreciated.
